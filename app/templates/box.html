    This paper describes the comparative study of Truncated DCT-SVD and DWT-SVD. In this paper we propose two different
    approaches to compute the feature vector for content based image retrieval (CBIR) system. SVD feature of
    successively truncated DCT image and DWT decomposed image computed for grayscale image, RGB and YCbCrcolor image.
    Truncated DCT and DWT decomposition SVD features of the image computed up to fifth level to compare the performance.
    Proposed methods incorporate with the multidimensional features vector computed by using SVD of low frequency
    coefficients of DCT and DWT of image. Similarity between the query image and database image measured here by using
    simple Euclidean distance and Bray Curtis Distance. The overall average precision and average recall crossover point
    of each image category. Proposed methods are tested on the augmented image database.
